# The Validation Course

This repo si the JS implementation of [haskell validation curse](https://github.com/madoos/haskell-validation-curse)

The course begins with two lessons on case expressions to ensure a solid foundation. From there, we write three functions for checking that inputs are valid passwords according to the rules of our system. The rest of the lessons iteratively expand on and refactor those functions into a small program that validates usernames and passwords, constructs a User if both are valid inputs, and returns pretty error messages if they are not. Along the way we learn about Monad and Applicative and how they are similar and different and how to use types to rethink our solutions to problems.
